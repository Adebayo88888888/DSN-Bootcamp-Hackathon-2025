# DSN-Bootcamp-Hackathon-2025

### Hackathon Context

This project was developed as part of DSN machine learning hackathon ahead of the AI Bootcamp.

Task: Predict the market price of used cars based on attributes such as brand, year, mileage, fuel type, transmission, etc.

Data:

train.csv — labeled training dataset (price is the target variable)

test.csv — test dataset (no price, predictions required)

sample_submission.csv — example of correct submission format

Evaluation Metric: Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)

Goal: Minimize RMSE between the true prices and the predicted prices on the test set.
